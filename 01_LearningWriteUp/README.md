### Concept Of Observability

`Observability` is the ability to understand and measure the state of a system, based upon the data generated by the system.

Observability will help in the following ways:

- Give better insights to the internal workings of a system or application
- Speed up troubleshooting
- Detect hard to catch problem
- Monitor performance of an application
- Improves cross-team collaboration

The main purpose of observability is to better understand the internals of the system.

When it comes to troubleshooting issues, we need more information that just what is wrong, we need to know why our application entered a specific state, we need to know what component is responsible and how we can avoid it in the future.

Observability gives us the flexibility to understand unpredictable events.

### Pillars of Observability
We accomplish observability through:

- `Logs`: These are records of events that have occurred and also having information about the specific event.
- `Traces`: This allows for following operations as they traverse through various systems & services
- `Metrics`: This provide information about the state of a system using numerical values

In a nutshell, prometheus is a monitoring solution that is responsible for collecting and aggregating metrics.
